# Special and Local Laws
criminal activities that the state government frames for specific issues
- 40% of all cognisable offences registered in 2021 under SLL
## Examples
1. [[Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967]]
2. [[Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act, 1999]]
3. [[Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012]] 
4. [[Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985]]
## Issues
1. deficient, vague, ambiguous definitions of offences such as 'terrorist act', 'unlawful activity', 'organised crime', 'organised crime syndicate'
2. [[Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012|POSCO]] applicable to consensual sexual activities between minors.
3. due process diluted - [[Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985|NDPS]] bail is near impossible
## Way forward
[[Jeremy Bentham#Pannomion|Pannomion]] - IPC should contain entirety of criminal offences. States create SLLs for various reasons. They should instead be given separate chapter inside the IPC, and CrPC.
