# 2023-10-04 Sikkim
- Glacier­ fed **Lhonak lake** in north Sikkim triggered a flash flood in the Teesta river ba­sin
- Cloudburst → glacial lake outburst → flood
- destroyed Chungthang dam → directs water to the Tessta-3 hydroelectric project
	- loss to National Hydel Power Corp (NHPC) - ₹233 crore
	- electricity generation of 1.8 GW halted
- destroyed 11 bridges
- (Sikkim has 80 glaciers, more than any other state)
- young soil - landslides
- Did not have [[#Early Warning Systems]]
## Lhonak lake
- Glacial retreat of 2km in 46 years between 1962-2008; 400m between 2008-2019.
# 2023 June Himachal
# Glacial Lake Outburst Flood
- sudden release of water from a lake fed by glacier melt
- large lakes formed from the melting of glaciers, suddenly breaking free of their moraine — natural dams that are formed from rock, sediment and other debris.
- There are an estimated 7,500 glaciers in the Himalayas
## Early Warning Systems
- implementable, but require coordination - multiple agencies promptly sharing satellite images; and a network of sensors to provide adequate warning
- GLOF events can be anticipated as we can monitor changes in the size of lakes
## Examples
1. 1926 Jammu and Kashmir deluge
2. 1981 Kinnaur valley floods in Himachal Pradesh
3. 2013 Kedarnath outburst in Uttarakhand
