# Amendment 2022
# Issues
- without specific efforts, resource allocation, the act cannot alone ensure conservation 
- Schedule 1 - barred from any exploitation - disincentivises the tree cultivation for ex. native trees
- Schedule 1 - includes invasive fauna like the spotted deer - causes harm to vegetation - but cannot be culled legally
- Schedule 1 - species pose physical, economic, and mental harm to people - Crocodiles, leopards, elephants - kill people, destroy livelihoods, leave lasting psychological impact
- (Amendment 2022) - elevated Nilgai, wild pigs to Schedule 1 - some stated had allowed limited culling of these problematic animals - would not be able to retain the policy
- Hunting was banned because the number of some species declined drastically. Hunting was done traditionally for hundreds of years. It could be allowed in regulated manner for species which are in abundance. This can support the livelihoods of local communities.
