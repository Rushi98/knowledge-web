- (2023) IMF predicts China's GDP growth rate <4% in the coming years
# Factors
## Investment vs Domestic Demand
Growth in China’s GDP was fuelled by investments, not domestic consumption. In 2010, Investment was 50% of GDP, domestic consumption 34%.
In fact, the Communist Party under President Xi has acknowledged this. In an essay last year, the Chinese President called for more “genuine,” not “inflated,” growth. A Carnegie Endowment paper notes that “genuine growth can be thought of as sustainable growth generated largely by consumption, exports, and business investment (with the last of these elements aimed mostly at serving the first two), whereas “inflated” growth consists mainly of nonproductive, or insufficiently productive, investment in infrastructure and real estate”. Analysts say the government will have to pivot towards a consumption-led model in order to manoeuvre out of the slowdown, which means putting more money in the hands of consumers instead of mobilising it for investments.
