**SIM** : subscriber identification module - identifies the subscriber on a given network
**IMSI** : international mobile subscriber identity
**GSM** : Global System for Mobile Communications standard
- Every SIM card stores this data and it is designed such that the user can’t access it through their phone. Instead, signals sent by the phone into the network are ‘signed’ by the key, and the network uses the signature to understand whether the phone’s connection is legitimate.
- It is possible to duplicate a SIM card by accessing its key and storing it in multiple cards.
- Until 2G networks, the term ‘SIM card’ denoted both the hardware and the corresponding software. This changed with the advent of the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System with 3G networks, when ‘SIM’ became only the software; the hardware was called the **Universal Integrated Circuit Card** (UICC). The software was also upgraded to an application called **Universal SIM**, or USIM, which could be modiﬁed to be compatible with the identification and security requirements of 3G, 4G, and 5G networks. As a result, a UICC loaded with both SIM and USIM applications can work with networks of all generations.
# eSIM
SIM software is loaded on to a UICC that is permanently installed in the mobile equipment in the factory itself, that it can’t be removed. Users using mobile equipment with this capability — such as the Google Pixels 2, 3, and 4 or the iPhone 14 series — don’t have to bother with physically replacing their SIM cards when they join or switch networks. Instead, the network operator simply has to reprogram the eSIM, which can also be done remotely.
### Advantages
- environmentally friendlier than a physical SIM - its reprogrammability means no need for more plastic and metal for a new SIM
- if a malicious person gains access to your phone, they won’t be able to separately access the SIM application nor be able to duplicate it
### Disadvantages
- In some countries, including the U.S., eSIMs can be programmed by subscribers themselves. But this process might be difficult for those with low digital literacy, such as the elderly.
- an eSIM can in theory allow network operators to track subscribers’ data, including inside apps on the device, especially in the absence of data privacy laws.
