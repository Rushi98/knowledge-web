Three body problem - If you know the starting positions of the sun, the earth, and the moon, can you predict their exact locations at a later date as they move under the influence of each otherâ€™s gravity?
Lagrange - assumption - third body is much smaller than the other two.
Three unstable points - L1, L2, L3 lie along the line connecting the large bodies
Two stable locations - apex of the equilateral triangle whose other two vertices are the two bodies
