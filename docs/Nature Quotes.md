# Anecdotes
## Typhoon Mangkhut
Guangdong province in China was one of the places where typhoon Mangkhut made a landfall in 2018. The cyclone was predicted and humankind was prepared to brace its impact but what came as a surprise was the tons of plastic waste, it left behind. There were plastic litters around residential areas, malls, cars etc. It felt like a return gift from nature for all the plastic dumps and environmental pollution we did over the years and a warning sign that it can’t take it anymore.
## 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami
In 2004, an Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami killed more than 230,000 people. The countries worst hit were Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India and Thailand, all of which had experienced significant declines in mangrove cover, according to a report by the Environmental Justice Foundation. From 1980 to 2000, the area covered by mangroves in these countries fell by 28%. In places where the trees had been destroyed, the waves penetrated further inland, killing more people and aggravating the destruction of homes and livelihoods. The “mangrove forests played a crucial role in saving human lives and property”, the report said.
Mangroves absorb the impact of waves and rising sea levels by their large root systems, which dissipate energy. “Conserving and restoring coastal mangrove areas is essential if coastal communities are to recover and be protected from similar events,” the report concluded.
