_Wolbachia_ are natural [[Bacteria|bacteria]] present in up to 60% of insect species, including some mosquitoes. When introduced into the Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, _Wolbachia_ can help to reduce the transmission of these viruses to people, decreasing the risk of [[Zika]], [[Dengue|dengue]], [[Chikungunya|chikungunya]] and [[Yellow fever|yellow fever]] outbreaks. _Wolbachia_ is safe for humans, animals and the environment. It does not suppress mosquito populations or involve genetic modification (GM) as the genetic material of the mosquito has not been altered.
