# Issues
## Incomplete scheduled areas
- Despite persistent demands by Adivasi organisations, villages have been left out in the 10 States with Scheduled Areas and in other States with ST populations. 59% of STs outside purview of article 244. In 1995, the Bhuria Committee, constituted to recommend provisions for the extension of panchayat raj to Scheduled Areas, recommended including these villages, but this is yet to be done. Reason - absence of viable ST ­majority administrative units. (Same reason for the de-notification of parts of Scheduled Areas where STs are now a minority due to the influx of non-­tribal individuals) ![[Screenshot 2023-10-11 at 7.53.20 AM.png]] ![[Screenshot 2023-10-11 at 7.52.11 AM.png]] In 1995, the Bhuria Committee, constituted to recommend provisions for the extension of panchayat raj to Scheduled Areas, recommended including these villages, but this is yet to be done.
