# Offences against women in conflict areas
The continuance of [[Armed Forces Special Powers Act|AFSPA]] needs to be revisited.
1. The requirement of **sanction for prosecution** of armed forces personnel should be specifically excluded when a sexual offence is alleged.
2. Complainants of sexual violence must be afforded **witness protection**.
3. **Special commissioners** should be appointed in conflict areas to monitor and prosecute for sexual offences.
4. **Training** of armed personnel should be reoriented to emphasise strict observance of orders in this regard by armed personnel.
