Potential to provide 10% of the total soil organic carbon sequestration globally
## Status of Black Soil
Black soils lost 20 to 50% of their original carbon stock, with the carbon being released to the atmosphere, mostly as COâ‚‚. Exacerbating global warming.
## Causes of losses
unsustainable management practices
excessive use of agrochemicals
erosion, nutrient imbalance, acidification, biodiversity loss
## Conservation tillage
zero tillage
