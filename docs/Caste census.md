# Viability
# Pros
- help policymakers identify marginalised and disadvantaged groups and design targeted interventions to uplift them
- fair representation of marginalised communities in government, education, and employment
- Reservations and affirmative action policies are often based on caste, and accurate data is crucial to determine the appropriate level of representation required
- A caste-­based census promotes transparency and accountability in government efforts to promote social justice. It allows citizens to hold the government accountable for the equitable distribution of resources and opportunities.
- The Indian Constitution recognises the existence of caste­-based discrimination and inequality and provides for affirmative action.
- Caste discrimination often leads to economic disparities - affirmative action - economic development for all
- education - eliminate discrimination within educational institutions

- may give boost to the political demand for a country­wide caste census
- push the judicial discourse towards reconsider­ing the 50% legal ceiling on total reservation in education and government services
- in politics - may open a new chapter in the traditional conflict between the BJP seeking to consolidate all sections of Hindus into one mas­sive support base and other parties banking on different sections of the OBCs
- the numbers may be utilised to present the sort of ‘quantifiable data’ that the judiciary has been asking for to jus­tify the levels of reservation obtaining in various States
## Methodology
- a code to each of the 214 castes in the State’s lists of castes
- Sub­castes and sects were identified in advance and subsumed under a broader caste name
- A major reason for the Union government not releasing the caste­ re­lated details of its 2011 ‘Socio­economic and Caste Census’ was that the data it yielded was too con­ fusing and unwieldy. As many as 46 lakh castes were named by the people, presumably because they gave castes, sub­castes, sects, clans, and sur­names when asked to name their castes.
# Conclusion
- While there are functional and practical advantages to knowing exact caste numbers, it is not to be for­ gotten that the larger goal of the Constitution re­mains the attainment of a casteless society.
- Affirmative action indeed helps address inequities in society. The state must also look for ways to en­ sure equality of opportunity and equitable distri­bution of resources without accentuating caste identity.
- Opposition party (INC) promise of removal of 50% cap on reservations.
