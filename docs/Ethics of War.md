# Morality of the state of engaging in an un-winnable conflict
## Sari Nusseibeh - Palestinian professor of philosophy
- The state is for the people, not the other way around.
- The stateâ€™s primary duty is to protect its citizens and to enable them to develop, prosper, enjoy family life, and move around freely within the country.
- However, the governing groups in the government, primarily interested in remaining in power, generate strong '*patriotic*' fervour to the extent of stimulating the people to sacrifice their life to save the country.
- If the state knows that it will not and cannot achieve its objective, and still perseveres in its objective, it will be acting immorally and unethically.
- What right does the state have to wilfully sacrifice so many lives for a cause it knows is unattainable?
- It would be obligatory for the state to dilute its war objective and to seek compromise.
