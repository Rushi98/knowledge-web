unexpected precipitation exceeding **100 mm per hour** over a geographical area of approximately 20 to 30 square km
# Disproportionate in Mountains
1. Terrain and elevation: In hilly areas, sometimes saturated clouds ready to condense into rain cannot produce rain, due to the *upward movement of the very warm current of air*. Instead of falling downwards, raindrops are carried upwards by the air current, creating sudden downpour.
2. The fragile mountain ecosystem is prone to disasters like landslides, which amplifies impact of cloud burst.
3. Rapid and indiscriminate construction activities are disturbing the delicate ecosystem balance of this region. E.g., recent cloudburst in Amarnath region.
4. Massive deforestation is a possible reason for disaster. E.g., Chopra committee (2014) established that haphazard construction of dams can cause irreversible damage to the region.
# Copenhagen Cloudburst Management Plan
- manage stormwater at the surface
- underground drainage tunnels
- lowering the water table so that the lake in the middle of Copenhagen can act as a reservoir to spare the sewers
