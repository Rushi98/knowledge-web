## Issues

- Prolonged implementation - census followed by [[Delimitation|delimitation]] is the condition
	- The parameter of population and reservation is irrelevant to women as their share in population being almost 50% is undisputed. There cannot be drastic variation in this proportion from one constituency to another as it can in case of ST, SCs.
	- Reservation for women in local bodies, which materialised through the 73rd and 74th Amendment Acts of the Constitution, and came into effect in 1993, was not contingent on any delimitation exercise for that purpose.
	- A constitutional Amendment relying on contingent legislation raises questions on certainty which is one of the hallmarks of modern constitutions.
