# On education
- acquisition of knowledge through work and craft at all levels and stages of education
- cultural aspects to be given importance
- basic knowledge embedded in the principles of sanitation, hygiene, nutrition, self-help and helping parents at homes
## Legacy
- **Delhi University** offers a mandatory value-added course **Integrating Mind Body and Heart (MBH)** which is handled through discussions, debates and discourse rather than relying on textbooks alone
- In Tamil Nadu, the Gandhigram Rural Institute (a Deemed-to-be-University) has been implementing **Nai Talim**, the Gandhian educational philosophy, through its academic programmes on Rural Development, Rural Economics, Cooperation, Development Administration, Rural Sociology, Rural Industries, Agriculture, Rural Health, and Sanitation.
