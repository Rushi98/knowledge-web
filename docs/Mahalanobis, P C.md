# Contributions to statistics
## Mahalanobis distance
- Metrics to find how much a point diverges from a distribution, based on measurements in multiple dimensions.
- It is widely used in the field of cluster analysis and classification.
- It was first proposed by Mahalanobis in 1930 in context of his study on racial likeness. During the course of these studies he found a way of comparing and grouping populations using a multivariate distance measure. Mahalanobis also took an interest in physical anthropology and in the accurate measurement of skull measurements for which he developed an instrument that he called the "profiloscope".
## Sample surveys
- introduced the concept of pilot surveys and advocated the usefulness of sampling methods.
- Early surveys began between 1937 and 1944 and included topics such as consumer expenditure, tea-drinking habits, public opinion, crop acreage and plant disease.
- Introduced a method for estimating crop yields which involved statisticians sampling in the fields by cutting crops in a circle of diameter 4 feet.
# Planning Commission
- [[Second five year plan]] - industrialisation on the basis of a two-sector model - Mahalanobis model
- key role in the development of a statistical infrastructure
- He encouraged a project to assess deindustrialization in India and correct some previous census methodology errors
