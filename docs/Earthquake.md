# Afghanistan triple earthquakes
- twin earthquakes due to thrust faulting near west terminus of Hindu Kush mountain range
- release of stress at one point lead to loading of stress at another point
- Afghanistan is located over multiple fault lines in the region where the Indian and the Eurasian [[Geology#Tectonic plates|tectonic plates]] meet. These plates collide often, leading to significant tectonic activity.
