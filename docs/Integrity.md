following moral conviction in doing all actions
even if no-one is watching
behave consistently with high moral standards
# Academic integrity
## History
- Piltdown Man in 1912 – a fraudulent attempt to fill in the missing link between primate and man
## Concerns
- small misconduct can have dire consequences for scientists and for the field – especially if those committing it are the field’s leaders
- other papers and findings free of misconduct that rely on the original but faulty work will also be brought into question, risking years of work
## Causes
- incentive structures for researchers 
	- incentivised to pursue more groundbreaking findings and results that support alternative hypotheses - encourages sloppy or outright fraud work
	- pressure to publish
- shortcomings in peer-reviews and replication studies
	- low risk of detection
- cultural norms around criticism
- the absence, or incompleteness, of policies at the national or at the institutional levels to penalise misconduct - [[UGC (Promotion of Academic Integrity and Prevention of Plagiarism in Higher Educational Institutions) Regulations, 2018]].
## How to deal
- Open Science Framework - 
	- pre-registration (i.e. fixing a study’s hypotheses, methods, and analyses before it is conducted and agreeing to share the results, whatever they are)
	- making research data more accessible
	- puts the researchers original intentions and eventual data up for scrutiny
## Conclusion
>The ability of science to keep out misconduct and police itself partly comes down to the choices individual researchers make. Whether it’s the temptation to be a bit less rigorous when double-checking a result or the values they impart to one’s mentees, the willingness to stick to scientific norms regardless of the impact it has on one’s prospects ultimately decides how far misconduct spreads.
