- elections were triggers for digital repression
- India incorporated censorship, including the use of automated systems, into the country’s legal fra­mework. [[The Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021#(4) deploy technology-based measures]] require large social media platforms to use AI ­based moderation tools for broadly defined types of content — such as speech that could undermine pu­blic order, decency, moral­ity, or the country’s sovereignty, integrity, and security, or content that of­ficials had previously or­dered removed.
- evaluated countries on five censorship methods -
	1. Internet connectivity restrictions
	2. blocks on social media platforms
	3. blocks on web­ sites
	4. blocks on VPNs
	5. forced removal of content
	India engaged in all of them except one (VPN blocking).
