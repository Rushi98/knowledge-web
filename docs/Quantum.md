# Quantum dots
size-dependent quantum effects
nanoparticles so tiny that their size determines their properties
- [[Nobel prize#Chemistry 2023]]
- quantum dots have different colours depending upon their size
- Quantum dots have also been called ‘artificial atoms’ because the dot as a whole behaves like an atom in some circumstances.
- Quantum dots lie somewhere in between and behave in ways that neither atoms nor bulk materials do.
