30 September 2023 - Presidential election - Mohamed Muizzu beat Ibu Solih.
## Abdulla Yameen
- Free Trade Agreement with China and loans for infrastructure → led to debt trap
## Ibu Solih
- "India First" policy 
- India undertook infrastructure projects, assisted in the pandemic, helped in UNGA Presidential campaign of Maldives Foreign Minister Abdulla Shahid
## Mohamed Muizzu
- Modi congratulated
- tasks - to grow economy as the debt repayments near; preside over referendum to choose between presidential or parliamentary democracy
- balance traditional, strategic interests (India - closest and most powerful neighbour; keen sight of US, China)
- "Will remove Indian forces from the Maldives" - value sovereignty - people don't want Indian soldiers
	- we will have a good relationship with these values
## Hopes
- BRI initiative is in serious trouble. Sri Lanka's example of unsustainable debt.
- Improved relations between India and the Gulf states.
- Positive mindset in people towards India due to development initiatives
# Issues
- India out campaign
- Increased Chinese presence in the strategically significant location
## Presence of Indian armed forces
naval and air force personnel have been stationed on the Addu and Lammu islands since 2013 in order to maintain and operate two helicopters and Dornier aircraft that India had loaned the Maldives for re­connaissance operations over the past decade
# Stand
- need to collaborate closely to address the chal­lenges confronting our re­gion such as transnational crimes and humanitarian assistance disaster relief
# Suggestions
- Ensure that there is not impression of playing "favourites" in the Maldives' domestic politics.
- Do not view India-Maldives interests as zero-sum game.
- Strengthen the [[Colombo Security Conclave]], [[Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi­-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation|BIMSTEC]]
