The [[Tribals|tribal]] community in Tamil Nadu witnessed state led brutality in 1992.
- On June 20, 1992, 269 Police, forest and revenue officials descended upon the village and ac­cused the villagers of hoarding illegally felled san­dalwood and allowing a conduit to smuggling. For the next three days, the villagers, women, the elderly and children included, were beaten up, their homes destroyed, wells poisoned and 18 women, including a girl, raped.
- The state refused to register a case against its officials. Villagers approached Madras High court and obtained CBI enquiry. Villagers won victory in the trial court in 2011 that convicted all accused under rape and atrocities charges. Successive state government appealed this to protect their bureaucrats.
- Villagers won the appeal in Madras High court. 
>At a time when the judiciary has been at odds with the go­vernment over attempts to maintain the [[Judicial autonomy|autono­my]] of the three branches of governance, the High Court’s judgment upholding the trial court’s con­viction, warns an elected government that it can­ not rule with impunity.
>This judgment is also a pivotal moment in the long battle for Adivasi rights. It will be re­ membered as a case where despite India’s stark inequities, the convergence of an alert [[Civil socie­ty]], committed lawyers, an independent judiciary and the resolve of victims seeking justice, could still work a democratic Constitution and the jud­icial system to their advantage.
