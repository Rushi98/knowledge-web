>For English, If one devotes around 5 full days, the paper can be covered comprehensively.
Scoring well in Grammar is essential. Refer to **Wren & Martin** which one can find on the net. If possible, try to go through **Solutions of Wren and Martin**. Then after getting the basics right, you can refer to **Paramount publishers book** on English. Moreover, even in the Essay and letter etc., try not to make grammatical mistakes which can be noticed easily.
Previous year **Solved papers by Access Publishers [A P Bharadwaj]** is very good. [For **IFS English-R. Gupta**] I would suggest the candidates go through all the previous year civils and IFS English papers with **a special focus on different kind of models, that were being repeated in the exam**
Regarding the topics to be covered in English, I am attaching the pdf of the notes I prepared, **Cover all kind of model questions** on the topics[Headings] I mentioned in these pdf. https://sandeepreddyifs.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/english.pdf https://sandeepreddyifs.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/english.pdf https://sandeepreddyifs.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/similar-words-eng.pdf
