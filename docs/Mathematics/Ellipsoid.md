1. Sum of squares of reciprocals of three mutually perpendicular [[Central conicoid#Diameter|diameters]] of an ellipsoid is constant. $\left(\frac{1}{PP_1^2} + \frac{1}{QQ_1^2} + \frac{1}{RR_1^2} = \frac{1}{4}\left(\frac{1}{a^2} + \frac{1}{b^2} + \frac{1}{c^2}\right)\right)$
# Diametral plane of $OP$
If $P\in F$, plane joining midpoints of chords parallel to $OP$ is diametral plane of $OP$.
## Conjugate semidiameter
Any three semi-diameters are conjugate if plane containing any two of them is diametral to third.
### Relation between extremities of conjugate semidiameters

> $$\left(\frac{x_i}{a},\frac{y_i}{b},\frac{z_i}{c}\right)$$ act as direction cosines of three mutually perpendicular lines.
1. $x_1^2+x_2^2+x_3^2=a^2$
2. $x_1x_2+y_1y_2+z_1z_2=0$
3. $x_1y_1+x_2y_2+x_3y_3=0$
4. sum of squares of three conjugate semidiameters = $a^2+b^2+c^2$
# Normals
1. There are six points on an ellipsoid the normal at which pass through a given point $(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)$. ![[six normals of ellipsoid through given point.png]]
# Volume
Volume of ellipsoid $\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} + \frac{z^2}{c^2}=1$ is $\frac{4}{3}\pi abc$.
