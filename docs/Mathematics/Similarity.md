# Diagonalisation
A linear operator $T:V\rightarrow V$ (or a matrix $A$) is diagonalisable if and only if its minimal polynomial $m(t)$ is a product of distinct linear polynomials.

## Real symmetric matrices are orthogonally diagonalisable 
- Eigenvectors of distinct eigenvalues of real symmetric matrix are orthogonal.
- Orthogonal matrix $P$ can be obtained by normalising a basis of orthogonal eigenvectors.
