# Anxiety disorders
# Depression
# Challenges
- poor awareness
- lack of help-­seeking behaviour (stemming from stigma)
- negatively labelling the counsellor as a "tension teacher" - reluctance to share concerns - privacy concerns
# Initiatives
- Tele-MANAS
- NIMHANS - National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences
# Suggestions
1. Move from the current “medical model” of mental health to the convergent model of mental health - recognise the complex interplay of behavioural, environmental, biological, and genetic factors throughout an individual’s life. For example - [[Whole School, Whole Community, Whole Child]].
