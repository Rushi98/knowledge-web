[**Issues in Centrally Sponsored Schemes**](https://yghmvg63.r.ap-south-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FYOnsyxh6V2I%3Fsi=SvhlBgecA_rQtHec/1/0109018b033becf9-6cbe8902-537d-4a7e-91aa-7cc4e04ec31d-000000/LCsh2co-kVoWfIr77MUJs9r0kOo=123)   

- The Trinamool Congress held a protest in Delhi over the **Centre stopping the release of funds** under MGNREGA & PMAY-G to West Bengal.
**Key Points:**
- **Centrally Sponsored Schemes:** These are schemes that are funded partially by both the Central and State Governments.
- It is a channel which the central government uses to help the states run their plans financially.
- The amount of state participation varies from state to state. Their **implementation** rests on the Union territories and the States.
- **Criticism:** CSS dictate Centers’ agenda and priorities which may not be relevant for states. CSS offers little flexibility for the states.
- **NITI Aayog’s** 2015 Sub-Group of Chief Ministers recommended rationalisation of CSSs.

- The 2023 Southwest Monsoon season in India had **erratic rainfall patterns**, starting with a severe deficit in June, followed by **surplus rainfall in July, a dry Augus**t, and record-breaking rains in **September**, ultimately resulting in a "normal" monsoon season.

 **Key Points:**

- Eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Gangetic West Bengal, southern-interior Karnataka and Kerala **ended the season with deficient rainfall.**
- The fluctuations in rainfall are **attributed to El Nino and the positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD)**.
- **El Nino** involves warming sea surface temperatures in the Pacific, leading to below-normal monsoon rainfall in India, while the **IOD** is associated with above-average monsoon rainfall in India.

- Overall, the season's early deficit was compensated by July's surplus and September's record rains, **resulting in a "normal" monsoon.**

- **Bombay HC** takes _suo motu_ cognisance of **35 deaths, including infants,** that took place in a government-run hospital in Nanded district of Maharashtra.

 **Key Points:**

- **Low dependence of Public hospitals:** National Sample Survey on health conducted in 2017-18, according to that  less than a third of the population depended on Public hospitals
- Health is a **State subject** as per our Constitution.
- About two-thirds of the total government expenditure on health comes from the State Governments and the balance one-third being provided by the Government of India.
- **Poor Doctor-to-Population ratio:** One government allopathic doctor for every 10,189 people, **WHO recommends 1:1000**
- **Insufficient Funding**: One of the major concerns is the administration’s lack of financial resources and insufficient funding for research and development.

- India’s government spent **2.1% of its GDP** on healthcare in **2021–22**, compared to 10% for Japan, Canada, and France.

[**Nobel Prize in Chemistry**](https://yghmvg63.r.ap-south-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FYOnsyxh6V2I%3Fsi=SvhlBgecA_rQtHec/4/0109018b033becf9-6cbe8902-537d-4a7e-91aa-7cc4e04ec31d-000000/zwzyyv9KYEBlCPIGwvZa2UtLkMA=123) 

- The 2023 Nobel Prize in chemistry was awarded to **Moungi G. Bawendi, Louis E. Brus and Alexei I. Ekimov** on Wednesday for the discovery and synthesis of **quantum dots**.
- These nanoparticles have wide-ranging applications across fields like electronics, advanced surgery, and quantum computing.

 **Key Points:**

- **Quantum dots:** Quantum dots are particles that are a few nanometres wide. They exhibit unique optical properties due to their small physical size.
- Their structure and atomic composition are the same as bulk materials, but the properties of the latter do not depend on their size.
- Quantum dots are used in **photovoltaic cells** to improve the absorption and efficiency in converting solar light into electricity.
- Quantum dots can be used as **security markers on currency and documents** as an anti-counterfeit measure.

[**Glacial lake Outburst**](https://yghmvg63.r.ap-south-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FYOnsyxh6V2I%3Fsi=SvhlBgecA_rQtHec/5/0109018b033becf9-6cbe8902-537d-4a7e-91aa-7cc4e04ec31d-000000/zics1Y1EcALim4-fnvCjPQJTJa8=123) 

- 14 people have been killed and 102, including at least 23 Army personnel, are missing in **Sikkim** as of Thursday morning after the **South Lhonak Lake** (a glacial lake situated in the state’s northwest at 17,000 ft) burst due to incessant rains, leading to the release of water in downstream areas.

 ** Key Points:**

- **Glacial lakes**: They are large bodies of water that sit in front of, on top of, or beneath a melting glacier.
- As they grow larger, they become more dangerous because glacial lakes are mostly dammed by unstable ice or sediment composed of loose rock and debris.
- **Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOF):** In case the boundary around them breaks, huge amounts of water rush down the side of the mountains, which could cause flooding in the downstream areas. This is called glacial lake outburst floods (GLOF).
- GLOF can be triggered by several reasons, including **earthquakes, extremely heavy rains and ice avalanches.**

- **Threats:** In the Himalayas, 25 glacial lakes and water bodies have witnessed an increase in water spread area since 2009.
