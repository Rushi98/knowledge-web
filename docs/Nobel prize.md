# Peace 2023
Narges Mohammadi 
The motto adopted by the demonstrators – “Woman – Life – Freedom” – suitably expresses the dedication and work of Narges Mohammadi.

**Woman**. She fights for women against systematic discrimination and oppression.

**Life**. She supports women’s struggle for the right to live full and dignified lives. This struggle across Iran has been met with persecution, imprisonment, torture and even death.

**Freedom**. She fights for freedom of expression and the right of independence, and against rules requiring women to remain out of sight and to cover their bodies. The freedom demands expressed by demonstrators apply not only to women, but to the entire population.
# Economics 2023
>- Structural transition of economy
>- Expectations - education - jobs
>- "mommy track", "greedy work"

Awarded to **Claudia Goldin** for having advanced our understanding of women’s labour market outcomes.
- **female participation in the labour market** did not have an upward trend over this entire period (200 years, US), but instead forms a **U-shaped curve**
- ![[Screenshot 2023-10-10 at 10.58.00 PM.png|The U shaped curve]]
 The participation of married women decreased with the transition from **an agrarian to an industrial** society in the early nineteenth century, but then started to increase with the growth of the **service sector** in the early twentieth century. Goldin explained this pattern as the result of structural change and evolving social norms regarding women’s responsibilities for home and family.
- **Women’s education** levels continuously increased, and in most high-income countries they are now substantially higher than for men. **Access to the contraceptive pill** played an important role in accelerating this revolutionary change by offering new opportunities for **career planning**.
- ![[Screenshot 2023-10-10 at 10.58.53 PM.png|The importance of expectations]] Despite modernisation, economic growth and rising proportions of employed women in the twentieth century, for a long period of time the **earnings gap** between women and men hardly closed. According to Goldin, part of the explanation is that **educational decisions**, which impact a lifetime of career opportunities, are made at a relatively young age. If the **expectations** of young women are **formed by the experiences of previous generations** – for instance, their mothers, who did not go back to work until the children had grown up – then development will be slow.
- ![[Screenshot 2023-10-10 at 10.59.48 PM.png|The parenthood effect]] Historically, much of the gender gap in earnings could be explained by differences in education and occupational choices. However, Goldin has shown that the bulk of this earnings difference is now between men and women **in the same occupation**, and that it largely arises with the **birth of the first child**.
	- Women cannot take on jobs that involve all ­consuming responsibilities. Parental responsibilities make it difficult for women to take on jobs requiring long hours and irregular work schedules.
	- One partner has to go on the slower and safer - "mommy track". Gender ideologies often prompt couples to assign women to take over extra family duties while men remain free to concentrate on their careers.
	- Professor Goldin blamed this inequality on “**greedy work**” that demands extraordinary efforts from workers rewarded with high salaries, big bonuses, stock options, and fast promotions. Rising **income inequality** leads couples to forgo gender equity within the household and concentrate on increasing family income via specialisation. Her solution to this dilemma is restructuring a workplace that does not rely on heroic efforts, has moderate work hours, and predictable schedules.
## Indian scenario
- women's employment rates low - growth of service sector should offer jobs to women
- rising education should increase their employability
- declining fertility should free up women's time
## Steps
- increased male participation in household work and childcare
- workspaces conducive to developing a work-life balance for both women and men
	- work structure respectful of employees time, not very long work hours - longer working hours do not mean increased productivity and in some jobs leads to mistakes and injuries
- rein in the greedy workspace - rein in institutions that demand more of our time
	- schools that rely on parents to supervise homework
	- urban developments that take place far from workspaces
## Suggestions
- (women often taking jobs that allow them to be on call at home) create more cou­ple equity → gender equality
