# Remote voting
- 2022 - ECI proposed a Remote EVM to address issues related 
## Goals
- improve voter turnout (67% in 2019 general election)
# Issues
- use of money power - liquor, cash, freebies, drugs; 
	- illicit online cash transfer through wallets
## Misuse of government officials
- DoPT asks senior officers to promote and advertise nine years (that corresponds to the two terms of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) that began in 2014.) of govt. achievements - "Rath Prabharis" (Special Officers). The Opposition Congress asked how civil servants could be asked to do such pre-­poll “political propaganda” for the government. **separation of powers - violated** -
	- the extensive election process in India has largely retained its credibility because of the bureaucratic impartiality demanded by the system.
- directing soldiers on annual leave to spend time on promoting government schemes, making them ‘soldier­ ambassadors’. **politicisation of military**
	- The military’s involvement in any kind of domestic politics is considered anathema.
