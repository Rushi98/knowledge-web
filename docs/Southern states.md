# Finance commission
- population share (14th FC 27.5% → 15th FC 15%)
- income distance ratio
- federal polity → equity, but there should be limits - 
	- so far the higher resource transfer to the backward states have not produced the expected improvement - in economy or in social welfare
		- identify non-distributive areas of intervention to bring about parity
	- redistribution not effective - income distance ratio still increasing
- under-utilization of revenue budget
# Delimitation
- no compulsion to change the ratio of representation in Parliament - 1971 population can be used
- constitution does not specify basis for Rajya Sabha seat distribution
- one person - one vote logic is inescapable
