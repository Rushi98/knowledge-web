One advisor, Arthur Schlesinger Jr., recalled the similar dilemma faced by President [[Abraham Lincoln]] during the Trent Affair in 1861. The Trent Affair was significant in that the US diplomats were able to avoid a war with Great Britain while fighting the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] against the Confederacy, and additionally convince Great Britain to remain a neutral party in the war. In both instances, leaders grappled with the risk of war with a major power. Kennedy, influenced by this historical rhyme, chose a diplomatic solution.

Goldin explained this pattern as the result of structural change and evolving social norms regarding women\u2019s responsibilities for home and family. - Women\u2019s education levels continuously increased, and in most high-income countries they are now substantially higher than for men. Access to the contraceptive pill played an important role in accelerating this revolutionary change by offering new opportunities for career planning. -  Despite modernisation, economic growth and rising proportions of employed women in the twentieth century, for a long period of time the earnings gap between women and men hardly closed. According to Goldin, part of the explanation is that educational decisions, which impact a lifetime of career opportunities, are made at a relatively young age. If the expectations of young women are formed by the experiences of previous generations \u2013 for instance, their mothers, who did not go back to work until the children had grown up \u2013 then development will be slow. -  Historically, much of the gender gap in earnings could be explained by differences in education and occupational choices. However, Goldin has shown that the bulk of this earnings difference is now between men and women in the same occupation, and that it largely arises with the birth of the first child.     - Women cannot take on jobs that involve all \u00adconsuming responsibilities. Parental responsibilities make it difficult for women to take on jobs requiring long hours and irregular work schedules.     - One partner has to go on the slower and safer - \"mommy track\". Gender ideologies often prompt couples to assign women to take over extra family duties while men remain free to concentrate on their careers.     - Professor Goldin blamed this inequality on \u201cgreedy work\u201d that demands extraordinary efforts from workers rewarded with high salaries, big bonuses, stock options, and fast promotions. Rising income inequality leads couples to forgo gender equity within the household and concentrate on increasing family income via specialisation. Her solution to this dilemma is restructuring a workplace that does not rely on heroic efforts, has moderate work hours, and predictable schedules.</p>"},{"location":"Nobel%20prize/#indian-scenario","title":"Indian scenario","text":"<ul> <li>women's employment rates low - growth of service sector should offer jobs to women</li> <li>rising education should increase their employability</li> <li>declining fertility should free up women's time</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Nobel%20prize/#steps","title":"Steps","text":"<ul> <li>increased male participation in household work and childcare</li> <li>workspaces conducive to developing a work-life balance for both women and men<ul> <li>work structure respectful of employees time, not very long work hours - longer working hours do not mean increased productivity and in some jobs leads to mistakes and injuries</li> </ul> </li> <li>rein in the greedy workspace - rein in institutions that demand more of our time<ul> <li>schools that rely on parents to supervise homework</li> <li>urban developments that take place far from workspaces</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"Nobel%20prize/#suggestions","title":"Suggestions","text":"<ul> <li>(women often taking jobs that allow them to be on call at home) create more cou\u00adple equity \u2192 gender equality</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Non%20Fiction%20Books/","title":"Non Fiction Books","text":"<ul> <li> We Are Poor but So Many: The Story of Self-Employed Women in India - Ela Bhatt</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Northeast%20Insurgency/","title":"Northeast Insurgency","text":"<p>Insurgency is an organised armed struggle by a section of the population against the state.</p>"},{"location":"Northeast%20Insurgency/#reasons","title":"Reasons","text":""},{"location":"Northeast%20Insurgency/#geographical-factors","title":"Geographical factors:","text":""},{"location":"Northeast%20Insurgency/#tough-terrain","title":"Tough Terrain","text":""},{"location":"Northeast%20Insurgency/#golden-triangle","title":"Golden Triangle","text":""},{"location":"Northeast%20Insurgency/#under-development","title":"Under-development","text":""},{"location":"Northeast%20Insurgency/#hostile-state-support","title":"Hostile state support","text":""},{"location":"Northeast%20Insurgency/#ethnic-divide","title":"Ethnic divide","text":""},{"location":"Northeast%20Insurgency/#administration-failure","title":"Administration failure","text":"<p>AFSPA</p>"},{"location":"Northeast%20Insurgency/#insurgent-group-division","title":"Insurgent group division","text":"<p>NSCN(IM) vs NSCN(K)</p>"},{"location":"Nuclear%20Fusion/","title":"Nuclear Fusion","text":"<p>\\(\\(_1^2D+_1^3T\\rightarrow _2^4He+ n^0 + (3.52 MeV)\\)\\) Yield - 4 times fission - 4 million times coal Requirements - &gt;100 million degree celsius temperature - pressure - plasma confinement</p>"},{"location":"Nuclear%20fission/","title":"Fukushima Daiichi radioactive wastewater release","text":"<ul> <li>expected to have negligible effect on people and ocean</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Olympic%20hosting/","title":"Olympic hosting","text":"<p>soft power, sports, costs</p> <p>soft-power medium sporting, economic and socio-cultural impact political legitimacy can give a vantage position in a shifting world order</p> <p>sporting success in Sports#Asian Games 2023</p> <p>prohibitive costs  - public outcry in Rio 2016, Tokyo 2020 - Tokyo 2020 ($15 Billion) - Victoria, Australia pulled out of hosting the 2026 Commonwealth Games;

If large-scale quantum computers are ever built, they will be able to break many of the public-key cryptosystems currently in use. This would seriously compromise the confidentiality and integrity of digital communications on the Internet and elsewhere. The goal of\u00a0post-quantum cryptography\u00a0(also called quantum-resistant cryptography) is to develop cryptographic systems that are secure against both quantum and classical computers, and can interoperate with existing communications protocols and networks. While in the past it was less clear that large quantum computers are a physical possibility, many scientists now believe it to be merely a significant engineering challenge. Some engineers even predict that within the next twenty or so years sufficiently large quantum computers will be built to break essentially all public key schemes currently in use. Historically, it has taken almost two decades to deploy our modern public key cryptography infrastructure.\u00a0 Therefore, regardless of whether we can estimate the exact time of the arrival of the quantum computing era, we must begin now to prepare our information security systems to be able to resist quantum computing.

They exhibit unique optical properties due to their small physical size.</li> <li>Their structure and atomic composition are the same as bulk materials, but the properties of the latter do not depend on their size.</li> <li>Quantum dots are used in\u00a0photovoltaic cells\u00a0to improve the absorption and efficiency in converting solar light into electricity.</li> <li>Quantum dots can be used as\u00a0security markers on currency and documents\u00a0as an anti-counterfeit measure.</li> </ul> <p>Glacial lake Outburst </p> <ul> <li>14 people have been killed and 102, including at least 23 Army personnel, are missing in\u00a0Sikkim\u00a0as of Thursday morning after the\u00a0South Lhonak Lake\u00a0(a glacial lake situated in the state\u2019s northwest at 17,000 ft) burst due to incessant rains, leading to the release of water in downstream areas.</li> </ul> <p>**\u00a0Key Points:**</p> <ul> <li>Glacial lakes: They are large bodies of water that sit in front of, on top of, or beneath a melting glacier.</li> <li>As they grow larger, they become more dangerous because\u00a0glacial lakes are mostly dammed by unstable ice or sediment\u00a0composed of loose rock and debris.</li> <li>Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOF):\u00a0In case the boundary around them breaks, huge amounts of water rush down the side of the mountains, which could cause flooding in the downstream areas. This is called glacial lake outburst floods (GLOF).</li> <li> <p>GLOF can be\u00a0triggered by several reasons, including\u00a0earthquakes, extremely heavy rains and ice avalanches.</p> </li> <li> <p>Threats:\u00a0In the Himalayas, 25 glacial lakes and water bodies have witnessed an increase in water spread area since 2009.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"Victor%20Hugo/","title":"Quotes","text":"<p>When God desires to destroy a thing, he entrusts its destruction to the thing itself.
